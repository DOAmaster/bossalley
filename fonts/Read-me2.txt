÷÷÷÷÷÷÷÷÷÷÷÷÷÷÷÷÷÷÷÷÷÷÷÷÷÷  COPYRIGHT LAW  ÷÷÷÷÷÷÷÷÷÷÷÷÷÷÷÷÷÷÷÷÷÷÷÷÷÷÷

This is a layman's explanation of the Copyright Law. 

	Copyright law gives protection to the authors of "original 
works of authorship". Such works include literature, drama, music, 
art and certain intellectual works. It does not matter whether such 
work is published or unpublished. 

	Mere OWNERSHIP of a book, manuscript, painting, or any other
copy does not give the possessor the copyright. 

	Copyright is secured automatically when the work is created. 
A work is created when it is fixed in a copy for the first time. "Copy"
means material objects from which a work can be read or visually seen 
either directly or with the aid of a machine or device.

Ads, Posters to announce Events, School Projects.
	Also = Fonts are copyright protected. This means you not re-sell
the font as a product. But using them on articles that are sold for
profit does not violate Copyright Law
